<h2 id="a-piece-of-red-cloth">A Piece of Red Cloth</h2>

<p><em>Cui Jian</em></p>

<p><strong>Verse A1</strong></p>

<p>That day, it was you that provide that red cloth,</p>

<p>which covered my eyes and my world.</p>

<p>You asked me what I see, I said I see the happiness.</p>

<p><strong>Verse A2</strong></p>

<p>With such a comfortable feeling,</p>

<p>I forgot that I don’t have a home.</p>

<p>You asked me where to go, I said I want to follow you.</p>

<p><strong>Verse A3</strong></p>

<p>Couldn’t see you, couldn’t see the road,</p>

<p>my hands were grabbed by you.</p>

<p>You asked me what I’m thinking, I said I would let you decide.</p>

<p><strong>Chorus B1</strong></p>

<p>I feel that you’re not the ion, but as strong and tough (as it).</p>

<p>I feel there are blood on you, for your hands are so hot and wet.</p>

<p><strong>Chorus B2</strong></p>

<p>I feel that here is not a wilderness, but I can’t see this land has become a drought.</p>

<p>I want to drink some water, but your lips have already covered my mouth.</p>

<p><strong>Post Chorus</strong></p>

<p>I couldn’t leave, neither could I wail, as my body has dried out.</p>

<p>I’m willing to accompany you this way, because I know most about your deepest pain.</p>
